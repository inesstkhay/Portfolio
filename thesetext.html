        <h1>Le Design Coopératif Opérationnel dans les pratiques professionnelles autonomisantes en architecture. Pour une approche sociotechnique de la durabilité.</h1>
        <h2>> September 2024 – ongoing – PhD in Architecture, supervised by Daniel Estevez (ENSA Toulouse) </h2>
        <h2>> How can urban design be grounded in everyday practices to support alternatives to top-down urban renewal?</h2>

        <h2>>Context</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This research questions design processes within French urban renewal projects, particularly those led by the NPNRU. While participation mechanisms exist, they are often symbolic and fail to reflect residents’ real expectations. At the same time, dominant urban planning still relies heavily on demolition-reconstruction cycles, which raise ecological, social, and symbolic issues. In response, this work investigates how inhabitants' uses, adaptations, and struggles can become sources of situated knowledge and drivers for transformation. The approach focuses on how architectural and digital design can integrate those situated dynamics, beyond institutional frameworks, in order to support more resilient and cooperative urban futures.</p>

        <h2>>Case studies: Two French neighborhoods with contrasting dynamics</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The research focuses on two neighborhoods targeted by national renewal policies: Le Mirail in Toulouse and La Noue / Clos Français in Montreuil-Bagnolet. Le Mirail, marked by large-scale demolitions, is the site of strong resident mobilizations. La Noue, with more limited demolition and stronger renovation efforts, reveals other tensions, notably around participatory processes and fears of gentrification. Comparing these two contexts enables a deeper understanding of the limits of official participation and highlights the need to anchor urban design in real, local dynamics of use, appropriation, and resistance.</p>

        <h2>>Research focus</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The thesis explores five interrelated areas:  
        <br><br>
        – <strong>Participation:</strong> What are the limits of current participatory mechanisms, and how do they reinforce power imbalances or symbolic exclusion?  
        <br><br>
        – <strong>Inhabitants’ Practices:</strong> How do residents adapt, resist, or reimagine their environment through everyday actions and collective initiatives?  
        <br><br>
        – <strong>Design from Use:</strong> Can we develop an architectural method grounded in use, care, and conflict? How can this be translated into situated modes of representation?  
        <br><br>
        – <strong>Digital Tools:</strong> How can socio-technical tools support the integration of everyday practices into design processes? Ihe research experiments with open and interpretative digital platforms.  
        <br><br>
        – <strong>Sustainability:</strong> Beyond technical performance, what ecological value lies in maintenance, reuse, and continuous adaptation of spaces? How can this challenge the logic of demolition and reconstruction?</p>
