        <p> Architect and PhD candidate, my work focuses on supporting residents (especially of working-class and marginalized neighborhoods) in reclaiming agency over the transformation of their environments, through collaborative and sustainable design practices.</br> 
        My research analyzes the limits of traditional participatory processes in architecture that confine users to participation forms aligned with neoliberal logics. Instead, I explore situated and continuous forms of design that allow spaces to evolve over time, embracing use, unpredictability, and collective agency as active forces of transformation. </br> 
        In this approach, the architect is not a top-down planner but a facilitator of local dynamics, an enabler and grassroots architect who works alongside residents to support the reclaiming and reimagining of their environments. Inhabitant-driven forms of resistance are understood as acts of defiance against dominant architectural production logics.</br> 
        My research also questions the use of digital tools in architecture, which are often centered on formal planning and top-down processes. I advocate for an open-ended approach that embraces indeterminacy, reimagining the role of digital tools to support more inclusive and situated design practices.</br> 
        This research ultimately challenges extractive models of urban renewal based on demolition and reconstruction. It asks how long-term, adaptive transformations rooted in everyday use, care, and collective imagination can redefine both the practice of architecture, and the political role of the architect.</br> </p>
